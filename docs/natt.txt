  NAT traversal notes
  -------------------

  Three main draft revisions exist as of March 2003:

  1) draft-ietf-ipsec-nat-t-ike-01.txt (expired)
  2) draft-ietf-ipsec-nat-t-ike-03.txt (expired)
  3) draft-ietf-ipsec-nat-t-ike-05.txt

  All three define two new ISAKMP payloads (NAT-D and NAT-OA), two new 
  IPsec encapsulation modes (udp-tunnel, udp-transport) and Vendor IDs
  to announce the support for particular NAT-T flavour.

  NAT-D payload is used NAT discovery, its format is the same for all
  3 drafts. ID values are different though.

  NAT-OA is Phase 2 payload and carries an Original Address information. 
  OA is used in the context of transport mode IPsec SA to allow for
  efficient IP checksum recalculation upon decapsulating ESP traffic.

  Two new encapsulation modes are UDP/ESP tunnel and transport. The idea
  is similar across the drafts, though specific IPsec DOI values and UDP 
  encapsulation procedure are different. Latter translates into earlier
  drafts using ISAKMP messages w/ zero cookies to carry ESP packets, 
  while recent drafts put ISAKMP messages into UDP/ESP packets w/ zero 
  SPI instead.

  Recent drafts also require peers to implement 'port floating', which
  is switching IKE traffic to a non-500 UDP ports once the presence of
  NAT has been detected.

  The following table summarizes the differences between all three drafts:
